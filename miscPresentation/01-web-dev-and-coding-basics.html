					## Tooling used in this presentation
					
					</div>
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
					- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
					- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
					
					</div>

					## Overview
					
					<img src="images/01-web-dev/overview.webp" style="background: white;">
					
					---
					
					## What is a website?
					
					- From the perspective of a web developer, a website is simply a collection of files that are made available on the internet via a web server!
					- A web developer is responsible for understanding how to create and maintain those files to fulfill the purpose of the website.
					
					---
					
					## Http & Domains
					
					<img src="images/01-web-dev/website-url-explained.jpg" style="background: white;">
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem;">
					  You can think of it as an addressbook for others to find the files of your website
					</p>
					
					---
					
					## HTML
					
					</div>
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Hypertext Markup Language
					- Establishes the "structure" of a website
					
					</div>
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.75rem; color: cyan;">
					  demo
					</p>
					
					---
					
					## HTML - Important concepts
					
					- This is only the starting point with a focus on <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span> should be contained on the page. 
					
					<img src="images/01-web-dev/html-anatomy.png" style="background: white;">
					
					---
					
					## CSS 
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Cascading Style Sheet
					- Builds on the structure of an HTML file to determine how your web browser renders the page
					
					</div>
					
					---
					## CSS - syntax
					
					```css
					selector {
						property1: value;
						property2: value;
					}
					```
					selector - a expression to reference html elements
					property / values - combinations 
					
					
					---
					## CSS - selector example
					
					```css
					/* this is an example of an element / tag selector */
					h1 {
						...
					}
					
					/* this is an example of a class selector */
					.btn {
						...
					}
					
					/* this is an example of an id selector */
					#save-button {
						...
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## JavaScript
					
					- The most commonly used language that defines the the <span style="font-style: italic;">functionality and behavior</span> of a website
					- Common behavior includes the following:
					  - Manipulate values on the web page
					  - Make additional web requests (send data to a server to save in a database)
					  - Managing "client-side" logical operations
					- Is a "Programming" language, in contrast to how HTML is a "Markup" language

					## JavaScript
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.75rem; color: cyan;">
					  demo
					</p>

					## Concept check!
					
					- What are the differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in terms of what they are responsible for?
					
					---

					## Exercise
					
					- Let's use developer tools to look at public websites like a web developer!
					- [Everybody get up](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/)

					---
					
					## Server-side concepts
					
					- There are key parts of our websites that we can't make available to the open internet. There are times were we need a trusted, centralized source for handling sensitive operations.
						- This includes Authorization, database read/write commands, Controlled access to resources, etc </br>

					## Differences in programming languages
					
					- In what situations would you pick JavaScript over C#, or C++, or Java, etc?
					- Understanding what tooling is available to be leveraged in those languages.
					
					---
					
					## (Optional) C# Coding Basics
					
					- [Basic C# Tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)
					
					---
					
					## In Summary
					
					- A web developer is responsible for broadly knowing the purpose of these tools, as well as when is the appropriate time to utilize each of them. 
					- There are many routes one can go in this career as many of these tools can get very specific and nuanced
