					## The MVC Design Pattern
					
					<img src="images/08-dotnet-mvc/MVC_Diagram.jpg" style="width: 75%;" />
					
					---
					
					## The MVC Design Pattern (cont)
					
					#### Model
					
					- Primarily responsible for representing the data structures needed by the application.
					- Oftentimes includes the needed logic pertaining to that data, however this is sometimes moved to a different application layer called the <span style="color: cadetblue">service layer</span>
						- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/models-data/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs#creating-a-service-layer">Microsoft Docs Example</a>
						
					---
					
					## The MVC Design Pattern (cont)
					
					#### View
					
					- The visual portion of the application that presents the information from the <span style="color: cadetblue">Models</span> to the user.
					- Within a web framework like ASP.NET Core MVC, the views are typically captured within our <span style="color: cadetblue">cshtml</span> files.
					
					---
					
					## The MVC Design Pattern (cont)
					
					#### Controller
					
					- Handles requests from the user, performs actions to update the Model, and directs which views to render.
					- Serves as the entrypoint to bridge the gap between your <span style="color: cadetblue">Front-end</span> and <span style="color: cadetblue">Back-end</span> logic.
					
					---
					
					## MVC - Concept Checks!
					
					For the following concepts, identify if it aligns most closely with the `Model`, `View`, or `Controller`. </br>
					- `cshtml`, `html`, and `css` files.
					- A C# class which defines the data structure of a user account on a website.
					- Presentation to the user.
					- Handling requests and directing the web application to render particular web pages.
