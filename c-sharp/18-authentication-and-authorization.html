					## Authentication vs Authorization
					
					<img style="width: 62%;" src="images/18-auth/authentication-vs-authorization.png" />
					
					- Related, yet slightly different
					
					---
					
					## Authentication
					
					#### Definition
					
					Verify the user is who they claim to be. </br></br>
					
					We primarily authenticate our users by requiring them to do something, or provide info that only the true user is able to do.
					
					---
					
					## Authentication
					
					#### Common workflows to Authenticate
					
					- Provide a Username / Password combination
					- [OAuth 2.0 / external providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio) (Linking your Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc)
					- [Multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/mfa?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
					
					
					---
					
					## Authentication
					
					#### Sessions vs. Tokens
					
					- These are two of the main patterns leveraged to allow a user to navigate around our websites while only having to authenticate themselves once (or once per timeout period).
					- Both of these approaches accomplish authentication, but the key focus for now should be focusing on when to use one approach over the other.
					
					---
					
					## Authentication
					
					#### Sessions
					
					<img style="width: 62%;" src="images/18-auth/session-cookie.png" />
					
					---
					
					## Authentication
					
					#### Sessions Vocab
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Session</span> - Information stored on the <span style="color: cadetblue">server</span> pertaining to a particular user and their state within the application.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Cookies</span> - Key/value pairs stored on the <span style="color: cadetblue">client</span> (user's web browser). Meant to store short-term data and is sent along to the server when making web requests.
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Considerations for sessions
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- It's an older pattern that relies on the web server managing <span style="color: cadetblue">state</span>
					  - When back-end applications have to worry about state, it can create scaling issues for larger applications.
					- Malicious actors can impersonate other users using this method if they are able to steal their cookies.
					- Session Ids must be stored and managed on your server.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Tokens
					
					<img style="width: 84%;" src="images/18-auth/session-vs-token.png" />
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Considerations for Tokens
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- Is more commonly used today and stores user state on the client (the user's web browser).
					- After authentication, the tokens are generated by the server and then passed off to the client.
					- Is the required approach when working within a <span style="color: cadetblue">stateless</span> application.
					
					</span>

					## Authorization
					
					#### Definition
					
					After we've established who you are, what are you <span style="color: cadetblue">permitted</span> to do?
					
					---
					
					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Core concepts
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- Identify the different types of users on your site, and slice up their permissions to match those use cases.
					  - Example: Site Admins, anonymous users, paid users, users creating data, users reading data, etc
					- Allows you to easily restrict parts of your site to only the group of users it is intended for.
					- There are a number of different ways you can slice up these groups of users (which we'll explore in some code examples here shortly).
					- When people talk about permissions, privileges, roles, user groups, claims, and policies, they are often referring to authorization.
					
					</span>

					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Identity Demo
					
					[EShop Demo link](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)
					
					[Ryan's Demo Code](https://github.com/RyanTheShaw/IdentityAuthExample)
					
					[Alternative Demo link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/secure-data?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
					
					<div class="fragment">
					
					As of 12/1/2021, it looks like the last demo link was broken when updated to .net 6, but it might be fixed in the future?
					</div>
				
					---
					
					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Key vocab
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[Authorize]</span> (attribute) - Marks a controller, or method to require that the user be authorized to access it.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[Authorize(Roles = "{enter role name here"]</span> (attribute) - Marks a controller or method to require authorization <span style="color: cadetblue">and</span> a particularly role to be able to access it.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[AllowAnonymous]</span> (attribute) - Allows for anonymous access to a resource from within a restricted resource.

					</span>

					## Authentication and Authorization - Concept Check!
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					1) What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
					2) How can I restrict access to a controller to only users that are signed into my site?
					3) Give some examples of potential <span style="color: cadetblue">roles</span> that I might define within my application.
