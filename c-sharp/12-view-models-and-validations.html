					## View Models and Validations</br>
					
					#### Key topics for tonight 
					<div style="text-align: left;">
						- View Models refresher </br>
						- Validations of View Models </br>
						- Enumerations
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## View Models
					
					Represents data as it is rendered in the view.
					
					---
					
					## View Models (cont)
					
					<div style="text-align: left;">
					
					Our ViewModels are almost always found within a folder titled `Models` or `ViewModels` within a MVC Web application. As these classes are strictly meant to assist in presenting data, they should always be contained within the Web Application.
					</div>
	
					---
					
					## View Models (cont)
					
					#### Best practices
					- Shouldn't contain excess logic that isn't directly related to the needs of the view.
					- When handling form submissions, it can be beneficial to create a ViewModels to represent the data sent via the form.
					- It can also be beneficial to create a ViewModel to represent the data being sent from the controller to the view at the page level.
					
					---
					
					## View Models (cont)
					
					#### Code Example
					
					```cs
					public class PersonViewModel {
						public string FirstName { get; set; }
						public string LastName { get; set; }
						public int Age { get; set; }
						
						public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
					}
					```
					
					<div class="fragment" style="color: cadetblue;">
						Demo
					</div>

					## Validations
					
					#### Why are validations important?
					
					- User Interface design is just as much about what you prevent the user from doing as what you enable them to do. 
						- This priniciple extends into the data that we allow the user to submit.
						- We can prevent the data via <span style="color: cadetblue">server-side validations</span>, and through <span style="color: cadetblue">client-side validations</span>.
					
					---
					
					## Client-side Validations
					
					#### Things to note
					
					- Not a replacement for Server-Side validation.
						- Malicious actors can adjust their client-side code to still send incorrect data!
					- Within common use cases it can give users more immediate feedback on the expectations of a field.
					
					---
					
					## Client-Side Validations
					
					#### Code Example
					
					<div class="fragment">
					
					[Demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#validating_against_a_regular_expression)
					</div>
					
					<div class="fragment">

					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Server-Side Validations
					
					#### Things to note
					
					- The Server Side code is 100% in our control, and is basically everything that is handled from the point of making it to the `Controller` on.
					- This means we can safely make our validations on the server, and there is no room for malicious actors to harm our system after after the fact.
					- This is considered a [defensive coding practice](https://medium.com/swlh/2-defensive-coding-techniques-you-should-use-today-4225cacc1c29)

					## Server-Side Validations
					
					#### Code Example
					
					<div class="fragment" style="color: cadetblue;">
						eShop Demo
					</div>
					
					</br>
					</br>
					</br>
					
					<div class="fragment">
						- Compare ModelState.IsValid vs !ModelState.IsValid approach
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## View Models / Validation - Concept Check!
					
					1) What is the difference between a View Model and the Model?
					2) Why might I want to use client side validation in addition to server side validation?
					2) What strengths does server side validation have over client side validation?
					
					---
					
					## Enums
					
					#### What are Enums?
					
					- An enumeration type (or enum type) is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type.
					- Enums are used when you want to represent a set of potential options along with associated integer values.
					
					---
					
					## Enums
					
					#### Code Example
					
					```c#
					/// <summary>
					/// Suit of a playing card
					/// </summary>
					public enum SuitKind
					{
						Clubs = 0,
						Diamonds = 1,
						Hearts = 2,
						Spades = 3
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Enums with bit flags
					
					#### Use case
					
					When you have a set of potential options that can contain zero, one, or many of those options.
					
					---
					
					## Enums with bit flags - Code
					
					#### Flagged Enum
					
					```c#
					[Flags]
					public enum Days
					{
						None      = 0b_0000_0000,  // 0
						Monday    = 0b_0000_0001,  // 1
						Tuesday   = 0b_0000_0010,  // 2
						Wednesday = 0b_0000_0100,  // 4
						Thursday  = 0b_0000_1000,  // 8
						Friday    = 0b_0001_0000,  // 16
						Saturday  = 0b_0010_0000,  // 32
						Sunday    = 0b_0100_0000,  // 64
						Weekend   = Saturday | Sunday
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Enums with bit flags - Code (cont)
					
					#### Console App Demo
					
					```c#
					public static void Main()
					{
						Days meetingDays = Days.Monday | Days.Wednesday | Days.Friday;
						Console.WriteLine(meetingDays);
						// Output:
						// Monday, Wednesday, Friday

						Days workingFromHomeDays = Days.Thursday | Days.Friday;
						Console.WriteLine($"Join a meeting by phone on {meetingDays & workingFromHomeDays}");
						// Output:
						// Join a meeting by phone on Friday

						bool isMeetingOnTuesday = (meetingDays & Days.Tuesday) == Days.Tuesday;
						Console.WriteLine($"Is there a meeting on Tuesday: {isMeetingOnTuesday}");
						// Output:
						// Is there a meeting on Tuesday: False

						var a = (Days)37;
						Console.WriteLine(a);
						// Output:
						// Monday, Wednesday, Saturday
					}
					```

					## Enums - Concept Check!
					
					1) Can you think of a good example of when you might use an Enum in your code?
					2) What does enabling enum flags allow me to do with that particular enum?
