					## Communication between Applications

					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### The need for distributed systems
					
					- It is important for the code that we create to interact devices other than the computer the application is running on. This can be through:
					  - Exposing data that we collect for others to view.
					  - Exposing actions that allow for others to interact with the systems that we create.
					- Established distributed system patterns allow for consistent behavior between these independent applications.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Vocab
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Internet of Things</span> (IoT) - term to describe devices that leverage the internet, sensors, and event driven programming to communicate with other devices and applications.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Separation of Concerns</span> - the design principle stating that individual responsibilities within a system / set of systems should be grouped and contained within logical parts.

					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Distributed Systems
					
					#### A use case
					
					1) I say "alexa, play surfin' bird at volumn 5".
					2) Alexa takes the sound waves I've made and generates an intention off of them.
					3) Alexa then makes a request to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">spotify api</a> to see if the song exists, and if so, play it.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Scenarios for Building an API
					
					- When there is a need in your application to expose actions or make data available to other systems.
					- GUIs are convenient for humans whereas APIs are convenient for other programs.
					- When you want your actions / data to be made available to a number of different end consumers.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Scenarios for Leveraging an API
					
					- When you're writing your own application and would like to leverage an already existing system.
					- When you don't want to recreate an already existing system for yourself.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Complexities
					
					- When depending on external systems, you must build your system in a way that fails gracefully when the dependent system is down.
					  - This means handling possible exceptions, implementing retry logic, handling concurrency issues, etc
					- Protecting against malicious actors who might try to issue a DDoS attack on your public Apis, handling high bandwidths, etc

					## Networking Layers & Http
					
					<img style="width: 62%;" src="images/19-rest-api/osi-networking-layers.jpg" />
					
					<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">OSI</span> (Open Systems Interconnection model) - A conceptual model of the different layers of responsibilties between telecommunication and computing systems.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Networking Layers
					
					#### Sending communications through systems
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- There are numerous responsibilities involved in communication between two network enabled devices.
					- As web developers, we're very fortunate that we almost never have to leave the <span style="color: cadetblue">application layer</span>, but it's important to know of the existence of the other layers.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
					
					#### Definition
					
					An <span style="color: cadetblue">application layer</span> protocol designed for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is also utilized by Rest Apis!
					
					<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">
					
					- Http is a `stateless protocol`, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
					
					</span>
					
					
					---
					
					## Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
					
					#### Example Http Request

					## Http - Request types

					## Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
					
					#### Example Http Response

					## Rest Apis
					
					#### High level concepts
					
					<span style="font-size: 1.85rem;">
					
					- Rest Apis are one of the most common ways of having applications and devices communicate with one another over the internet.
					- Rest Apis are widely used and one of the most approachable ways for developers to define how two systems can communicate.
					- Rest Apis are stateless which means that each request is able to execute in isolation without a continuous session between client and server.
					
					</span>
					
					
					
					---
					
					## Rest Apis
					
					#### Vocab
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Rest</span> (<a href="https://restfulapi.net/">Representational State Transfer</a>) - An architectural style that imposes constraints on how ditributed systems communicate through the internet.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Api</span> (Application Programming Interface) - A defined intermediary that allows two applications or systems to talk to each other.
					
					---
					
					## Rest Apis in .Net
					
					#### High level
					
					- There are two main approaches to building Apis in .Net in the modern tech stack
					   - Classic controller based Apis
					   - .Net 6 Minimal Apis (released November 2021)
					- Since the classic controller based Apis are more similar to what we've learned with MVC, we will mostly be looking at them today.

					- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio">Minimal API .Net 6 tutorial</a>
					- <a href="https://github.com/RyanTheShaw/TodoList.Api">Ryan's github example code</a>

					## Rest Apis - Concept Check!
					
					1) What are some of the reasons that I might choose to create a Restful Api?
					2) In the context of Http, what is the difference between `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`?
					3) In C#, what are some of the common gotchas when interfacing with someone else's API? How do we go about debugging those issues?
