					## Communication between Applications
					
					<img style="width: 62%;" src="images/19-rest-api/rest-diagram.png" />
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### The need for distributed systems
					
					- It is important for the code that we create to interact devices other than the computer the application is running on. This can be through:
					  - Exposing data that we collect for others to view.
					  - Exposing actions that allow for others to interact with the systems that we create.
					- Established distributed system patterns allow for consistent behavior between these independent applications.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Vocab
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Internet of Things</span> (IoT) - term to describe devices that leverage the internet, sensors, and event driven programming to communicate with other devices and applications.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Separation of Concerns</span> - the design principle stating that individual responsibilities within a system / set of systems should be grouped and contained within logical parts.

					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Distributed Systems
					
					#### A use case
					
					1) I say "alexa, play surfin' bird at volumn 5".
					2) Alexa takes the sound waves I've made and generates an intention off of them.
					3) Alexa then makes a request to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">spotify api</a> to see if the song exists, and if so, play it.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Scenarios for Building an API
					
					- When there is a need in your application to make expose actions or make data available to other systems.
					- GUIs are convenient for humans whereas APIs are convenient for other programs.
					- When you want your actions / data to be made available to a number of different end consumers.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Scenarios for Leveraging an API
					
					- When you're writing your own application and would like to leverage an already existing system.
					- When you don't want to recreate an already existing system for yourself.
					
					---
					
					## Communication between Applications
					
					#### Complexities
					
					- When depending on external systems, you must build your system in a way that fails gracefully when the dependent system is down.
					  - This means handling possible exceptions, implementing retry logic, handling concurrency issues, etc
					- Protecting against malicious actors who might try to issue a DDoS attack on your public Apis, handling high bandwidths, etc
					
					---
					
					## Networking Layers & Http
					
					<img style="width: 62%;" src="images/19-rest-api/osi-networking-layers.jpg" />
					
					<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">OSI</span> (Open Systems Interconnection model) - A conceptual model of the different layers of responsibilties between telecommunication and computing systems.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Networking Layers
					
					#### Sending communications through systems
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- There are numerous responsibilities involved in communication between two network enabled devices.
					- As web developers, we're very fortunate that we almost never have to leave the <span style="color: cadetblue">application layer</span>, but it's important to know of the existence of the other layers.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
					
					#### Definition
					
					an <span style="color: cadetblue">application layer</span> protocol designed for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is also utilized by Rest Apis!
					
					<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">
					
					- Http is a `stateless protocol`, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
					
					</span>
					
					
					---
					
					## Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
					
					#### Example Http Request

					## Rest Apis
					
					#### High level concepts
					
					<span style="font-size: 1.85rem;">
					
					- Rest Apis are one of the most common ways of having applications and devices communicate with one another over the internet.
					- Rest Apis are widely used and one of the most approachable ways for developers to define how two systems can communicate.
					- Rest Apis are stateless which means that each request is able to execute in isolation without a continuous session between client and server.
					
					</span>
					
					
					
					---
					
					## Rest Apis
					
					#### Vocab
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Rest</span> (<a href="https://restfulapi.net/">Representational State Transfer</a>) - An architectural style that imposes constraints on how ditributed systems communicate through the internet.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Api</span> (Application Programming Interface) - A defined intermediary that allows two applications or systems to talk to each other.
					
					---
					
					## Rest Apis in .Net
					
					#### High level
					
					- There are two main approaches to building Apis in .Net in the modern tech stack
					   - Classic controller based Apis
					   - .Net 6 Minimal Apis (released November 2021)
					- Since the classic controller based Apis are more similar to what we've learned with MVC, we will mostly be looking at them today.
					
					---

					## Rest Apis - Concept Check!
					
					1) What 
					
					
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Considerations for sessions
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- It's an older pattern that relies on the web server managing <span style="color: cadetblue">state</span>
					  - When back-end applications have to worry about state, it can create scaling issues for larger applications.
					- Malicious actors can impersonate other users using this method if they are able to steal their cookies.
					- Session Ids must be stored and managed on your server.
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Tokens
					
					<img style="width: 84%;" src="images/18-auth/session-vs-token.png" />
					
					---
					
					## Authentication (cont)
					
					#### Considerations for Tokens
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- Is more commonly used today and stores user state on the client (the user's web browser).
					- After authentication, the tokens are generated by the server and then passed off to the client.
					- Is the required approach when working within a <span style="color: cadetblue">stateless</span> application.
					
					</span>

					---
					
					## Authorization
					
					#### Definition
					
					After we've established who you are, what are you <span style="color: cadetblue">permitted</span> to do?
					
					---
					
					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Core concepts
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- Identify the different types of users on your site, and slice up their permissions to match those use cases.
					  - Example: Site Admins, anonymous users, paid users, users creating data, users reading data, etc
					- Allows you to easily restrict parts of your site to only the group of users it is intended for.
					- There are a number of different ways you can slice up these groups of users (which we'll explore in some code examples here shortly).
					- When people talk about permissions, privileges, roles, user groups, claims, and policies, they are often referring to authorization.
					
					</span>

					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Identity Demo
					
					[EShop Demo link](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)
					
					[Ryan's Demo Code](https://github.com/RyanTheShaw/IdentityAuthExample)
					
					[Alternative Demo link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/secure-data?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
					
					<div class="fragment">
					
					As of 12/1/2021, it looks like the last demo link was broken when updated to .net 6, but it might be fixed in the future?
					</div>
				
					---
					
					## Authorization (cont)
					
					#### Key vocab
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[Authorize]</span> (attribute) - Marks a controller, or method to require that the user be authorized to access it.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[Authorize(Roles = "{enter role name here}"]</span> (attribute) - Marks a controller or method to require authorization <span style="color: cadetblue">and</span> a particularly role to be able to access it.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">[AllowAnonymous]</span> (attribute) - Allows for anonymous access to a resource from within a restricted resource.

					</span>

					## Authentication and Authorization - Concept Check!
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					1) What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
					2) How can I restrict access to a controller to only users that are signed into my site?
					3) Give some examples of potential <span style="color: cadetblue">roles</span> that I might define within my application.
