					## Classes - Part 1 </br>
					
					#### Key topics for tonight 
					<div style="text-align: left;">
						
						- High level overview of classes </br>
						- Anatomy of a class </br>
						- Instantiating an object from a class </br>
						- Combining it all with code examples
					</div>
					
					---
					## Intro to Classes
					
					#### Big Ideas
					
					- Classes are an organizational tool in our code to create templates for what we expect our <span style="color: cadetblue;">objects</span> to contain. 
					- Classes are meant to <span style="color: cadetblue;">encapsulate</span> related programming responsibilities.
					- These concepts are all part of something we call <span style="color: cadetblue;">object oriented programming</span>.
					
					---
					## Intro to Classes (cont)
					
					#### Encapsulation
					
					<img style="width: 50%;" src="images/03-classes-part-1/encapsulation.jpg" />
					
					<div class="fragment" style="text-align: left;">
						The bundling of data with methods that operate on that data
					</div>
					
					---
					## Intro to Classes (cont)
					
					#### Encapsulation
					
					```c#
					public class Square {
						// Properties
						public double Length { get; set; }
						
						// Methods
						public double CalculateArea()
						{
							return Length * Length;
						}
						
						public double CalculateCircumference()
						{
							return Length * 4;
						}
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Anatomy of a Class
					
					#### Vocabulary
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Constructor</span> - The method which is called when a class is instantiated.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Field</span> - Variables that are meant to be used internally to the class.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Properties</span> - Variables which are used both internally and externally to the class.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Methods</span> - Functions which are defined within a class, and can leverage the data within a class.
					
					---
					## Anatomy of a Class - Code Example

					```c#
					public class Square {
					
						// Properties
						public double Length { get; set; }
						
						// Fields
						public int _numberOfSides;
					
						// Constructor
						public Square(double length) 
						{
							this.Length = length;
							_numberOfSides = 4;
						}
						
						// Methods
						public double CalculateArea()
						{
							return Length * Length;
						}
						
						public double CalculateCircumference()
						{
							return Length * _numberOfSides;
						}
						
						public void DisplayStats()
						{
							Console.WriteLine("Here are some stats on your square!\n"
								+ $"Length: {Length} units\n"
								+ $"Area: {CalculateArea()} units squared\n"
								+ $"Circumference: {CalculateCircumference()} units in length"
							);
						}
					}
					```

					---
					## Access modifiers
					
					- <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">An access modifier determines how other parts of the code can interact with the type or member which is being modified.</span>
					- <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">For now, we only need to worry about <span style="color: cadetblue;">public</span> and <span style="color: cadetblue;">private</span>, but we'll return to the other ones later when we talk about <span style="color: cadetblue;">inheritence</span></span>
					</br>
					
					<img src="images/03-classes-part-1/access-modifier-chart.png" />
					
					---
					## Access modifiers (cont)
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Public</span> - The type or member can be accessed by any other code.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue;">Private</span> - The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
					
					---
					
					## Instantiation
					
					- When you create a new object in C# for a class using the new keyword, then it is called instantiation.
					
					```c#
					// Instantiating an object from a class
					Square SquareObject = new Square();
					```
					
					---
					
					## Instantiation (cont)
					
					#### Instantiating via an overloaded constructor
					
					```c#
					// Instantiating an object from a class
					Square SquareWithLengthFive = new Square(5);
					```
					
					<div class="fragment" style="text-align: left;">
						This method requires the creation of additional constructors in the class definition.
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Instantiation (cont)
										
					#### Instantiating via an object initializer
					
					```c#
					// Instantiating an object from a class
					Square SquareWithLengthFive = new Square()
					{
						Length = 5
					};
					```
					
					<div class="fragment" style="text-align: left;">
						This method is more common these days as it doesn't require constructor overloading to set properties.
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Calling methods on objects
					
					<div style="text-align: left;">
						Now that we've created our objects, let's make some calls to the methods within them!
					</div>
					
					```c#
					Square SquareObject = new Square(5);
					SquareObject.DisplayStats();
					```
					
					---
					
					## Calling methods on objects (cont)
					
					#### Storing return types
					
					
					On our method `CalculateArea()`, our return type is a double. The code example below shows us how to store that returned value in a variable.
					
					
					```c#
					Square SquareObject = new Square(5);
					double area = SquareObject.CalculateArea();
					```
					
					---
					
					## Combine it all with code examples!
					
					#### Adjusting access modifiers
					

					- What would happen if we gradually made some of our properties and methods <span style="color: cadetblue;">private</span> rather than <span style="color: cadetblue;">public</span>?
					- What would that convey to the other developers using this code?

					
					<div class="fragment" style="color: cadetblue;">
						demo
					</div>
					
					---
					## Access modifiers (cont)
					
					#### Code Example
					
					```c#
					public class Square {
					
						// Properties
						public double Length { get; set; }
						
						// Fields
						private int _numberOfSides;
					
						// Constructor
						public Square(double length) 
						{
							Length = length;
							_numberOfSides = 4;
						}
						
						// Methods
						private double CalculateArea()
						{
							return Length * Length;
						}
						
						private double CalculateCircumference()
						{
							return Length * _numberOfSides;
						}
						
						public void DisplayStats()
						{
							Console.WriteLine("Here are some stats on your square!\n"
								+ $"Length: {Length} units\n"
								+ $"Area: {CalculateArea()} units squared\n"
								+ $"Circumference: {CalculateCircumference()} units in length"
							);
						}
					}
					```

					## Classes - Concept check!
					
					<ol>
						<li>When might we want to use classes in our programs?</li>
						<li>What is the difference between <span style="color: cadetblue;">public</span> and <span style="color: cadetblue;">private</span>, and why might I use one over the other?</li>
						<li>What is meant by the term <span style="color: cadetblue;">encapsulation</span> in the context of classes?</li>
						<li>What is the difference between a property and a field?</li>
					</ol>
					  
					---
					
					## Single Responsibility Principle
					
					  - Each class definition should concern itself with one concept or responsibility.
					  - This is true for both the data and functionality contained within a particular class
					  
					---
					
					## Single Responsibility Principle
					
					#### Code examples - property violation
					
					```c#
					// below is an example of a class that violates the single responsibilty principle!
					public class Person {
						public string Name { get; set; }
						public DateTime BirthDay { get; set; }
						public int Age { get; set; }
						
						// The property "PetsName" violates the single responsbility principle
						public string PetsName { get; set; }
					}
					```
					
					<div class="fragment" style="text-align: left;">
						Not everyone has a pet, and that property is more closely tied to the Pet itself rather than the person!
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Single Responsibility Principle
					
					#### Code examples - function violation
					
					```c#
					// This function does TWO things. Generates the string, as well as displays it to the console.
					public void DisplayStats()
					{
						Console.WriteLine("Here are some stats on your square!\n"
							+ $"Length: {Length} units\n"
							+ $"Area: {CalculateArea()} units squared\n"
							+ $"Circumference: {CalculateCircumference()} units in length"
						);
					}
					```
					
					<div class="fragment" style="text-align: left;">
						An alternative approach could be to have the function return the string, and let the invoker of the function decide what to do with it.
					</div>
