					## Object-Relational Mapping
					
					#### Definition
					
					Object-Relational Mapping is a technique for accessing and manipulating data stored in a database via an object-oriented programming language (such as C#!)
					
					---
					
					## Object-Relational Mapping (cont)
					
					#### Why it's important?
					
					- Allows us to make <span style="color: cadetblue">CRUD</span> operations against our database easily from our application code.
					- Assists us in defining <span style="color: cadetblue">one</span> dedicated entry point into our database.
					- ORM Libraries give us many functions that assist in creating good data access patterns.
					- Allows us to treat database entities as c# classes, instead of executing sql statements as strings.
					
					---
					
					## Object-Relational Mapping (cont)
					
					#### Comparing SQL Query vs. ORM
					
					```MySql
					# Fetch data from database via sql query
					SELECT * FROM People WHERE FirstName = 'Ryan';
					```
					
					vs
					
					```C#
					// Fetching data from database via C# / ORM
					MySqlDbContext context = new MySqlDbContext();
					context.People.Where(p => p.FirstName == "Ryan");
					```
					
					---
					
					## Object-Relational Mapping (cont)
					
					#### Pros of ORM
					
					- Building logic around strings is <span style="color: red">bad</span> (in almost any context).
					- By having our database interactions driven by C# objects, we gain <span style="color: cadetblue">compile time</span> assurances, much like the rest of our C# code!
					- Natively protects against <span style="color: red">SQL Injection</span> attacks!
					
					---
					
					## Object-Relational Mapping (cont)
					
					#### Console App Demo
					
					<span style="color: cadetblue">demo</span>
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework
					
					#### What is it?
					
					Entity Framework is one of the most common ORM libraries within the .NET ecosystem. It offers a number of different ways to manage your long-term data access via C#. 
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Key Concepts
					
					- Supports a number of different relational databases, so you can still use entity framework with many different types of sql (Sql, MySql, Sqlite, PostgreSQL, etc).
					- Provides us various base classes that we need to implement to properly use the framework.
					- You'll need to install the required NuGet packages for whichever Sql instance you're attempting to connect to.

					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Database First vs Code First
					
					- <span style="color: cyan">Database First</span> - Used when connecting to an already existing database. Adjustments to the schema are managed outside the code.
					- <span style="color: cyan">Code First</span> (Migrations) - Used when we want to make adjustments to the schema through changes in our C# code. 
					
					<div class="fragment">
					
					For tonight's class we will be primarly looking at Database First, but we will look at the Code First approach in more detail in part 2's lecture.
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Important ef classes / methods
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- <span style="color: cyan">DbContext</span> - Implementations of this class defines a connection to a database, and is the entry point for the actions that we want to take against it.
					- <span style="color: cyan">DbSet</span> - Defines a table within a database, and is the entry point to performing CRUD operations against that table.
					- <span style="color: cyan">DbContext.OnConfiguring()</span> - A <span style="color: cadetblue">virtual</span> method which allows for you to define how to connect to your database (such as what the <span style="color: cadetblue">connection string</span> should be).
					- <span style="color: cyan">DbContext.SaveChangesAsync()</span> - This method must be called to sync the changes made in the DbContext to the real database. 
					
					</span>
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Return to Console App demo
					
					- Walk through DbContext, DbSet, and OnConfiguring()
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Adding a record
					
					```C#
					public static void AddPerson(MySqlDbContext context)
					{
						var person = new Person()
						{
							FirstName = "Jackie",
							LastName = "Chan"
						};

						context.People.Add(person);
						context.SaveChangesAsync();
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Updating a record
					
					```C#
					public static void UpdatePerson(MySqlDbContext context, int Id)
					{
						var person = context.People.Find(Id);

						person.LastName = "LOL U HAVE A NEW LAST NAME";

						context.People.Update(person);
						context.SaveChangesAsync();
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Deleting a record
					
					```C#
					public static void DeletePerson(MySqlDbContext context, int Id)
					{
						var person = context.People.Find(Id);
						
						context.People.Remove(person);
						context.SaveChangesAsync();
					}
					```
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Setup witin an MVC Project
					
					- Connection string information can be stored in our appsettings (or other IConfiguration file sources). This takes the place of the `OnConfiguring()` method override as it was used in the console app.
					- The Startup.cs file will allow you to bind your DbContext via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-6.0">dependency injection</a>.

					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Revisit eShop MVC project
					
					[demo (with link to project)](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)
					
					---
					
					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Misc things to note / possible gotchas
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					- If you're working with docker containers, your server value in the connection string will likely be different.
					- Tonight we looked at <span style="color: cadetblue">Database First</span> as it is much more simple to start with, but there are many pros to using <span style="color: cadetblue">Code First</span> as we'll discuss next class.
					- Entity Framework uses [conventions](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/conventions) when mapping C# classes / properties to the database. If your names don't follow the conventions, you might have issues pulling data!
					
					</span>

					## Entity Framework (cont)
					
					#### Different patterns used
					
					- [unit of work / repository patterns](https://gunnarpeipman.com/ef-core-repository-unit-of-work/)
					- [ef core github - basic usage](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore#basic-usage)

					## Entity Framework - Concept Check!
					
					<span style="font-size: 2rem;">
					
					1) What are some of the perks of using an ORM?
					2) What is a connection string? What infomation is stored within a connection string?
					3) Name two ways I can connect my C# DbContext with an actual database.
					4) How could I find a people in my database with first name "Ryan", and update their last name to "BLARGH"?
