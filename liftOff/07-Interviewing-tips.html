					## Types of Interviews
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Behavioral / Introductory objectives
						- Determine if you're a good fit
						- If you work well with others / match the culture 
						- Can communicate clearly
					- Technical objectives
						- Test your abilities & knowledge
						- Demonstrate your problem solving process 
						- Speak to technical problems you've solved before
					
					</div>

					## A quick recap
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Jump back to slides from [lecture 04](https://ryantheshaw.github.io/Unit2Slides/liftOff/04-live-coding-and-interviews.html)
					- Important ideas:
						- What to do in a live coding interview
						- Using the correct language to represent software engineering concepts / ideas
						- Learn how to translate work you've done in the past into describing abstract types of problems that you already have experience solving

					## Preparing for the technical interview
					
					#### Ryan's Readiness checklist
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.35rem">
					
					- Ensure that your LinkedIn profile and resume are updated with your most recent experience. If interviewing in person, make sure that you have additional copies of your resume to share if need be.
					- Practice your answer to the question "Hello {interviewee}, tell us a little bit about your background and what you are hoping to do in your next role?".
					- Practice vocalizing your live coding process either alone, or with a trusted peer.
					- Clearly identify for yourself what you're looking for in your upcoming role, and prepare questions around those goals to determine if the job will be a good fit for you.
					- Research the company you're interviewing with ahead of time.
						- Come prepared with questions about the company / team / technologies used by the team.
						- Consider [the Joel test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) or [Joel test alternative](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/331869/time-to-replace-the-joel-test).
					- Mentally review all of your technical experiences up through this point such that you feel comfortable speaking to it in an interview (at least at a high level).

					#### What do the questions typically look like for a junior dev?
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Refer back to the [defining success slide](https://ryantheshaw.github.io/Unit2Slides/liftOff/01-intro-and-kickoff.html#/4).
					- Questions will mostly be fairly fluid, and will likely continue increasing in complexity until we cover topics you aren't as familiar with. <span style="color: cadetblue">This is fine and to be expected from junior devs</span>.
					- If you seem to have prepared ways to convey your technical knowledge ahead of time, good interviewers will allow you to relate their questions back to your concrete experience.
