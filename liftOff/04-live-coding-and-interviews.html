					#### Key topics for tonight 
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
						
						- Technical conversations / Live coding / technical assessments / project demos </br>

					## What to expect in studio
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Typical project stand up
					- Project Review 1
						- As a group you'll need to demo your progress so far with your mentor.
						- The goal was to have a working <span style="color: cadetblue">landing page</span> and every team member to have <span style="color: cadetblue">completed at least one user story</span>.
					- Live coding exercise
						- Alternate roles within your group between interviewer / interviewee.
						- Focus on the exercise of <span style="color: cadetblue">live coding</span>, not so much on just getting the right answer.
					
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Quick reminder
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Keep in mind:
						- If you run out of defined stories in your backlog, it's a good idea to plan out an ad hoc planning session with your group to define more user stories!
						- Mentors are there to help with any issues that come up. If you find yourself hitting any roadblocks while working within your group, feel free to reach out to them for clarification / suggestions!

					## Proving your technical knowledge
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					When interviewing for a technical position, it isn't unusual to be expected to prove your technical knowledge in some capacity. 
					
					This is most commonly accomplished through <span style="color: cadetblue">technical conversations</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">live coding sessions</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">technical assessments</span>, and <span style="color: cadetblue">demoing existing projects</span>.
					
					</div>

					## technical conversations
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					Things to keep in mind: 
					
					1) Try your best to use the proper language to represent technical topics (it's a good idea to practice this with your peers!).
					2) Ask questions if they use terms you aren't familiar with.
					3) Come prepared with a "sales pitch" for yourself. 
						- What technologies & patterns did you use in your liftoff project? 
						- What are the high level topics you covered though LC 101?
					4) Be confident in the things you do know, and curious about the things you don't!
						
					</div>

					## Live Coding sessions
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.5rem">
					
					Things to keep in mind: 
					
					1) Ahead of the live interview, identify the steps you will aim to follow when solving a problem in front of others.
						- Example: `Read through the requirements` -> `Identify any assumptions` -> `take an initial stab of solving the problem` -> `analyze your solution and discuss improvements / other considerations` -> `ask for feedback`.
					2) Vocalize your process! The intention of a live coding session is to ensure the candidate is able to be given a problem and work towards a solution. Being able to convey your thoughts and communicate effectively is a major skill as a junior developer!

					## Live Coding sessions (cont)
					
					#### Demo
					
					- [Example test](https://app.testgorilla.com/preview/528468)
					
					---
					
					## Technical Assessments
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.5rem">
					
					Things to keep in mind: 
					
					1) As technical assessments are often times not timed, the expectation to demonstrate quality code is a little bit higher.
						- It's important to have consistent styling within your code.
						- Create a root level <a href="https://readme.so/">ReadMe</a> file explaining how to run your program, any assumptions, and any other relevant notes for the person judging your project.
						- If the project merits creating unit tests, it's a good idea to include them as well!
					2) Be sure to start early and focus on identifying what problems need solved. If you're unsure of how to solve a problem as part of the assignment, you can use this as a learning opportunity and plan around how you can best design a solution to their requirements.
					3) Even though it's an assessment, it's still a good idea to initialize a git repository around your work.

					## Demoing existing projects
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					Things to keep in mind: 
					
					1) This format allows you to put in a lot of effort ahead of time to convey your technical skills.
					2) You should focus on areas of your code that demonstrates an understanding of key programming concepts. Even if it highlights something that feels second nature to you now, it's worth mentioning!
						- Example: "This project follows the <span style="color: cadetblue">MVC design pattern</span> and allows for me to easily follow the <span style="color: cadetblue">Separation of Concerns principle</span>"
					3) Highlight the things you're proud of that's completed, and call out in what ways you are growing / could grow the application as well as how you'd that.

					## Interview tips
					
					#### Things to keep in mind
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.5rem">
					
					1) Be professional. Be engaged. 
					2) Come prepared with your questions / concerns as well! Interviewing goes both ways.
						- Example good questions as an interviewee
							- "In what ways do you prioritize professional growth within your engineering teams?"
							- "Could you describe the last time a team member was promoted from within and what the path looked like?"
							- "In what ways do you encourage mentorship between junior and senior developers on your development teams?"
					3) Be confident in what you do know, and up front about what you don't. Remember that the people interviewing you do this professionally, so don't have any skills on your resume that you aren't prepared to speak to in the interview!
