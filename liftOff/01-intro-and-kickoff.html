					</div>
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					  To assist in getting us there, we will be exploring topics around the needs of managing software development projects, collaboratively working with others, resume building, interviewing, coding challenges, and more.

					## SDLC (cont)
					
					#### Definition
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					The Software Development Life Cycle is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.
					
					Within different SDLC <span style="color: cadetblue">methodologies</span>, the the execution and timeline of these steps vary, but the order mostly stays the same.
					
					</div>

					## SDLC (cont)
					
					#### For this course
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					We will be using a fairly minimalistic approach to the <span style="color: cadetblue">agile methodology</span> for this course. Agile works within short iterations (or sprints) to allow for pivots on the plan for the project as work gets completed and new insight into the direction of the project is uncovered.
					
					</div>
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					  Note -- Some other common SDLC methodologies include: <span style="color: cadetblue">Waterfall</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">Scrum</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">Lean</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">Kanban</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">DevOps</span>, and <span style="color: cadetblue">Extreme</span>. There are plenty of articles online comparing these different approaches should you be interested in learning more!

					## Planning - User Stories
					
					#### Definition
					
					A short description of a new feature to be added to a software system, told from the perspective of a <span style="color: cadetblue">user</span>.

					## User Stories (cont)
					
					#### What do we use them for?
					
					We use them for planning and tracking our work! 
					
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
