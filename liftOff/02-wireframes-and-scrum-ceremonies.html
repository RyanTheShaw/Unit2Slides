					## Wireframes
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					Simplistic visual User Interface (UI) representations for a particular software system feature.
					
					</div>

					## Wireframes (cont)
					
					#### Things to focus on
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Keep your wireframe simple.
					- Focus on clearly presenting the layout of the page.
						- What actions can the user take on the page?
						- What data is viewable and where?
					- Questions that a wireframe will assist in answering.
						- "Is this the ideal layout for the page?" 
						- "Should this page have more or less functionality?"
						- "Is the workflow within this page clear?"
					
					</div>

					## Storyboarding
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					Taking our established wireframes and estbalishing <span style="color: cadetblue">workflows</span> within our system. This sometimes is explored through the concept of a <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/">User Persona</a>.

					## Storyboarding (cont)
					
					#### Things to focus on
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Focus on how the various parts of your system fit together.
					- Identify any actions that need to be take to change between parts of the storyboard.
					- Questions that a wireframe will assist in answering.
						- "Is our proposed workflow addressing all of the user's needs?" 
						- "Is there a more efficient workflow (can we minimize clicks?)"

					## Collaborative Git Practices
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					When working in a shared code project under one git repository, all developers must interact with the repository in a similar way to prevent confusion and chaos in the codebase.
					
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Collaborative Git Practices (cont)
					
					#### Git Branches / Merges
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Shared Branch</span> - A branch that is meant to be utilized by all members of the team. Expectations on code quality for these branches should be high (unit tests / manual tests are run) as it can impact other developers ability to work on their task.
					- <span style="color: cadetblue">Feature Branch</span> - A branch that is either tied to a feature, task, proof of concept, or some other pending work item. These branches won't impact other developers until it is merged into a shared branch.
					
					</div>

					## Git Branches / Merges
					
					#### Considerations
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- If you need to manually merge in changes, take your time and make sure you aren't deleting someone else's work! This is a destructive action.
					- Don't carelessly merge your items into a shared branch. Look over your <span style="color: cadetblue">git diff</span> and verify all your changes are in there. Manually test the application as well (automated testing is better if you can manage that).
					- Consider requiring a code review on merges via GitHub's pull request interface.
					
					</div>

					## Gitflow
					
					<img src="images/02-wireframes/gitflow.png" style="background: white;">
					
					---
					
					## Gitflow
					
					#### Summary
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- The develop branch is your main shared branch, and should always be in a stable state.
					- Newly created work items are <span style="color: cadetblue">cut</span> from develop and named feature branches. 
					- Once feature branches are completed, they are verified and merged back into develop.
					- Once you're supporting a live version of your website, the main/master branch should always be in the same state as the live website.

					## Goals

					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Goal 1: Have properly planned work in the backlog.
						- Captured in User Stories
						- Team has clear expectations on acceptance criteria
						- Visual wireframes / storyboards / mockups made where appropriate
					- Goal 2: Order the work items based on dependencies.
					- Goal 3: Assign work items and set goals as a team for the week.
					
					</div>

					## Expectations for bi-weekly meetings (stand ups)
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					- Go down the list of items in progress with each assignee identifying any blockers, or collaberative needs.
					- Identify what you plan to do between now and the next meeting.
					- Identify any dependencies between work items and try to call out any action items to organize efforts around them.
