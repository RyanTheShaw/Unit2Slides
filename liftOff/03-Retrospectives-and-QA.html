					## Retrospectives
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					Intentional time set aside for the development team to reflect on <span style="color: cadetblue">what went well</span>, <span style="color: cadetblue">what didn't go well</span>, and what (if any) <span style="color: cadetblue">action items</span> should be taken. 
					</br>
					</br>
					</br>
					Retrospectives are one of the most important ceremonies that enable for our development teams to <span style="color: cadetblue">continually improve</span>.
					
					</div>
					
					---
					
					## Retrospectives - Outline
					
					<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.75rem">
					
					1) Come to the meeting prepared with your thoughts on what went well, what didn't go well, and what action items should be taken for the next sprint.
					2) Identity common themes as a team, and then spend time sharing thoughts on how best to adjust your process to prevent the same pain points from arising in the future. Celebrate your successes as a team as well!
					3) Potential themes of issues could be:
						- "After I started working on my user story, it turns out I still had questions on the acceptance criteria."
						- "We overestimated the amount of work we could get done this sprint, and it's causing for a lot of our work to <span style="color: cadetblue">roll over</span>."
						- "I'm finding it hard to pair-program with other developers on the team, and I feel like that's negatively affecting our output."
						- "I noticed that broken code was sometimes getting merged into our shared branches, and that hindered my ability to get started on my user story."
